Hi, Iâ€™m Ricardo Carvalho.

I am a data scientist and PhD student on SFU (Simon Fraser University) working on privacy-preserving data mining. My current research is primarily focused on designing and optimizing deep learning models, such as GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks), to learn from data without compromising the privacy of any individual present in the data, using the framework of Differential Privacy.

Before joining SFU for my PhD, I worked as a Senior Data Scientist for the Brazilian Goverment for over 6 years and carried out consultancy work for companies, government and individuals interested in connecting data science to businesses.

I also worked for almost an entire year as Data Science Manager for the Observatory of Public Spending (ODP), leading more than 15 data professionals on projects connecting data science, fraud prediction and auditing.

Both learning and teaching are my great passions. I still mentor some students interested in improving their data skills. I taught data mining at two federal universities in Brazil in the past. And I have completed innumerous online courses related to data science. 

My Master's is in Computer Science / Machine Learning, completed at UnB (University of Brasilia). I also graduated from the certificate program in Data Science from University of Washington (UW), and I'm a Computer Engineer from ITA (Aeronautics Institute of Technology), one of the most prestigious schools in Brazil.

I'm fortunate to have a beautiful family: a lovely wife and a wonderful 2yo daughter. And in my spare time, I like to play guitar and drums, and also enjoy playing FIFA on my PS4 (feel free to challenge me :).
