## Short Bio

I am currently a PhD student on Simon Fraser University (SFU) working on privacy-preserving data mining. My current research focus on deep learning and differential privacy. Before joining SFU, I worked as a Senior Data Scientist for the Brazilian Goverment for over 6 years and carried out consultancy work for companies, government and individuals interested in connecting data science to businesses. I also worked for almost an entire year as Data Science Manager for the Observatory of Public Spending (ODP), leading more than 15 data professionals on projects connecting data science, fraud prediction and auditing.
