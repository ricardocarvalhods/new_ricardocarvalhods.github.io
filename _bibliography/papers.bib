    abstract={College attrition is a chronic problem for institutions of higher education. In Brazilian public universities, attrition also accounts for the significant waste of public resources desperately needed in other sectors of society. Thus, given the severity and persistence of this problem, several studies have been conducted in an attempt to mitigate undergraduate dropout rates. Using H2O software as a data mining tool, our study employed parameter tuning to train 321 of three classification algorithms, and with Deep Learning, it was possible to predict 71.1% of the cases of dropout given these characteristics. With this result, it will be possible to identify the attrition profiles of students and implement corrective measures on initiating their studies.},

This approach is carried out to propose alternatives to customers return to timely payments situation, but the efficiency of this approach is small, accounting for only about 6.8% of customers. A predictive model, using classification was used to help identify customers with the most potential to return to a normal situation, reaching a 85.5% accuracy rate with the winning algorithm, Gradient Boosting Method. It was implemented in the integrated Platform H2O with R language, exploring the grid mode and parallel processing models advantages.},

    abstract={The Department of Research and Strategic Information (DIE), from the Brazilian Office of the Comptroller General (CGU), is responsible for investigating potential problems related to federal expenditures. To pursue this goal, DIE regularly has to analyze large volumes of data to search for anomalies that can reveal suspicious activities. With the growing demand from the citizens for transparency and corruption prevention, DIE is constantly looking for new methods to automate these processes. In this work, we investigate IT purchases anomalies in the Federal Government Procurement System by using a deep learning algorithm to generate a predictive model. This model will be used to prioritize actions carried out by the office in its pursuit of problems related to this kind of purchases. The data mining process followed the CRISP-DM methodology and the modeling phase tested the parallel resources of the H2O tool. We evaluated the performance of twelve deep learning with auto-encoder models, each one generated under a different set of parameters, in order to find the best input data reconstruction model. The best model achieved a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.0012775 and was used to predict the anomalies over the test file samples.},

    abstract={This paper presents a case study of machine learning applied to measure the risk of corruption of civil servants using political party affiliation data. Initially, a statistical hypothesis test verified the dependency between corruption and political party affiliation. Then, we constructed datasets with standardization and three different discrimination techniques. Using Weka environment, this work shows the application and statistical evaluation of four classification algorithms to build models for predicting risk of corruption: Bayesian Networks, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, and Artificial Neural Networks with back propagation. To evaluate the models we used data mining metrics such as precision, recall, kappa statistic and percent correct. Lastly, the case study compares the learned model with the best performance to the experts' model. The comparison not only confirms previous experts' affirmations, but also provides new assertions on the affiliation-corruptibility relation.},

    abstract={This study proposes a predictive model to detect the delay in bank teller queues. Since there are penalties and fines applied to the branches that leave their clients waiting for a long time, detecting these cases as early as possible is essential. Four models were tested: one using a Queuing Theory's formula and the other three using Data Mining algorithms - Deep Learning (DL), Gradient Boost Machine (GBM), and Random Forest (RF). The results indicated the GBM model as the most efficient, with an accuracy of 97% and a F1-measure of 75%.},

    abstract={The need for efficient techniques for dealing with large databases increases as the number of large databases grows. We propose a new two-phase parallel learning approach to identify similar structures of relational databases fast. Each phase represents a level of relational metadata aggregation. To test the approach, we realized an experiment in with several large databases of Ministry of Social Development of Brazil to classify which relational database have a similar structure of tables and columns, based on its metadata. The measure of similarity considered Levenshtein and cosine. Generalized Linear Model, Random Forest, and Gradient Boost Machines (GBM) techniques are applied to develop the model. Each model was executed in sequential and parallel processing and had performance compared. As results, the parallel execution of GBM was at least ten times faster than the sequential processing. The results encourage further applications of the propositional parallel learning in relational databases.},

With thousands of extracted features related to corruptibility, the data were processed using techniques like correlation analysis and variance per class. We also compared two different discretization methods: Minimum Description Length Principle (MDLP) and Class-Attribute Contingency Coefficient (CACC). The feature selection process used Adaptive Lasso. To choose our final model we evaluated three different algorithms: Naive Bayes, Tree Augmented Naive Bayes, and Attribute Weighted Naive Bayes. Finally, we analyzed the rules generated by the model in order to support knowledge discovery.},

  abstract={After the Federal Court of Audit's decision on Judgment 1601/2005, the Brazilian Government has sought to reduce expenditure on telephone expenses. In this understanding, the Presidency of the Republic acquired Telecom Expense Management software, which proposes to provide telephone management, focusing on the efficiency in the use of resources and reducing the risk of having particular phone calls paid by the government. However, the software has not yet resulted in the volume of savings expected and required after the issuance of Decree 8.540/2015, which sets goals for reducing the consumption of resources with telephone expenses. The present paper studies the behavior of organization mobile phones of Brazilian Republic Presidency, in order to detect outliers through clustering processes as K-means, FarthestFirst and others, composed by calls registers with characteristics (time, duration and day of the week) that are not related to the corporation use. The results accused that 33 thousand calls were suspect of being private, about 10%, against 0.5% of previous solution and a confirmation that 90% of the suspicious calls obtained by the K-means method could be refunded in a sample presented to some employees of the Presidency of the Republic.},

We conducted experiments using two different classifiers: random forest and support vector machine. The caret package in R language was used for this work. When we employed the random forest classifier, we got accuracies 4 percent points greater than the baseline accuracy, suggesting that the textual content of financial statements has some potential use for debt prediction.},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
